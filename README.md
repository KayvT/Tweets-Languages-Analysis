# Languages-Analysis-with-Tweets

### In this notebook, using tweets collected randomly from some contries(Egypt , France , and Turkey ), and Facebook's model fastText for language identification, we interpret and analyze the data in various ways

### How to use it

- Clone the repo and view the notebook on your machine. I do not recommend displaying the notebook on Github.
- Install the required libraries.
- Download the fasttext's model(lid.176.bin) from <a href='https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/language-identification.html'>here</a>, since we load it in the notebook. And we did not push it because of its size.
